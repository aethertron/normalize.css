# normify.css v0.1

Forked from [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) - "customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards."

More:

- opinionated
- responsive
- still no classes

Why automatically fluid img but not canvas, iframe, video, svg? [E.g. Fluidity.](http://fluidity.sexy/)

Images are frequently used. They may be dropped all over the place without any specific styling applied. But the use of canvas and the rest of them is likely to be more deliberate, and considered styling will be applied to them as a matter of course. And you might decide that the width should be allowed to exceed its container, or not, apply your desired CSS at will.

Classes are good. You should add lots of them to your markup.
